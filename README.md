PROJECT DESCRIPTION :
We are a group of pet technicians creating a prototype relational database system using MySQL and MySQL Workbench for veterinarian, Dr. Patel, in Charlotte, North Carolina. Dr. Patel has an existing record of customers that we will use as the starting point for our project. Our system will cater to dog and cat owners that need assistance with pet care. The services will include: boarding, pet visitation, walking, feeding, day care, bathing, shopping, and medication administration. Our database will have the capacity to enter new information, edit existing information, and generate reports for Dr. Patel. This program will be available on the web for customers to request services
